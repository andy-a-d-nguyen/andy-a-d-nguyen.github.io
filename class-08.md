## List Comprehensions

According to <https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python>, list comprehensions provide a very concise way to create lists and these lists can be created from predicates, function calls or other expressions. Python also has similar ways to create other data structures to reduce verbosity and improve convenience in creating them. They are set comprehension, dict comprehensions and generator comprehensions according to <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comprehensions-in-python/>
