## Pain and Suffering

According to <https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering>:

```md
The difference between pain and suffering is that suffering is pain without purpose, pain with no higher goal, dreams, ambitions or aspiration
```

This topic is important in that it talks about an idea that struggling toward a goal can be a painful, yet rewarding endeavor.

## Big O

According to <https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation>:

```md
In computer science, Big O generally refers to the performance of an algorithm with regards to its input and describes the worst-case scenario in terms of time or space required to execute the algorithm
```

Big O is an important concept for programmers to know because as a program, one should always aim to solve programming problems using algorithms that are as efficient as possible due to the fact that memory and computing power are not cheap. At the same time, efficient algorithms also produce results faster
