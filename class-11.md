## JupyterLab

According to <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html>, JupyterLab can be considered an IDE for Python that runs in the browser, but provides a view that is similar to a notebook. In a `.ipynb` file, markdown texts and code snippets can be seamlessly shown together, but at the same time, one can run the code in these code snippets known as cells. JupyterLab can also view files in multiple data format such as csv, json, and more.

## NumPy

According to <https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/>, NumPy is a very useful Python library that makes handling structured data a simple task. It can read CSV or SSV files and perform calculations on the data it gets in a very fast and efficient manner because most of the work it's doing is done in the C programming language, which is very fast.
