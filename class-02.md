## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Discussion Questions

#### 1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

One of the more important things to consider is the time and space complexity of the of the data structure. For example, arrays have an O(1) lookup time if you know which index you are looking for, as opposed to linked lists, which have an O(n) lookup time because you always have to search from the beginning of a linked list

#### 2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

According to <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPEJSJMg4jY>, to avoid an infinite recursive call stack, we need to have a base case
