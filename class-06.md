## The Random Module

According to <https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python>, the random module is very useful for generating random numbers or picking random elements. Being able to use random numbers is a very useful feature in that passwords can be made more secure by using randomly generated numbers as an example.

## Risk Analysis

According to <https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/>, risk analysis is about determining what risks might exist in developing applications, measuring potential impacts from having risks and coming up with plans to resolve or reduce such risks. A real life example can be saving money. Since no one knows what is going to happen in the future and people can only make educated guesses at best, many of them put money away money or other things of value for when something unexpected comes up such as illnesses or accidents.

## Test Coverage

According to <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html>, having good test coverage is not about how many tests were written or how much code in an application was tested, but more about ensuring that tests cover all possible scenarios. An real life example can be crash tests that are done to a prototype vehicle. Before a vehicle is put into production, its manufacturer test that vehicle by crashing it into different obstacles to ensure that the passengers can survive and that the vehicle meets the required safety standards.

## Big O Notation

According to <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw>, Big O talks about the time or space an algorithm takes to solve a problem with respect to the size of the algorithm's input. A real life example can be the act of jogging. Jogging 1 mile will take longer than jogging 3 miles given 3 miles is longer than 1 mile. The Big O of time for jogging can then be summarized as roughly O(N) (the relationship between distance to jog and time to jog is approximately linear)
