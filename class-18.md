## Encryption, Decryption, and Hacking

According to <https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:online-data-security/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:data-encryption-techniques/a/encryption-decryption-and-code-cracking>, encryption is the process of scrambling data using a technique and each act of encrypting can vary in the technique used. Decryption is about using the same technique in reverse to retrieve the original data. WIthout knowing the technique(s) used to encrypt certain data, one can attempt to crack the technique(s) used using a variety of methods. Some of them are frequency analysis, deduction from partial plaintext and brute force.

According to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher>, the Caesar cipher is one of the most widely known and oldest encryption technique that involves shifting the alphabets by a number of positions, up to 25, and was invented by Julius Caesar, who used it by shifting the alphabets in his messages 3 positions. Nowadays, there are many more secure and sophisticated techniques for encryption and the Caesar cipher should not be used.
