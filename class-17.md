## Web Scraping

According to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping>, web scraping is the act of extracting data from websites. One common technique of web scraping is to crawl the html data of a website using automated software. Using the Beautiful Soup Python library, according to <https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-web-scrape-with-python-in-4-minutes-bc49186a8460>, one can scrape the html content of a web page and extract information from it.

Because web scraping increases traffic to a website, but these traffic aren't from real users and thus do not generate potential sales leads or revenue, some websites are against web scraping. At the same time, by allowing search engines to scrape them, these websites are able to be indexed by the search engines and show up as search results. One way to avoid being blocked from web scraping a website is to try to mimic human actions by slowing the rate of requests made to the website according to <https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-prevent-getting-blacklisted-while-scraping/>. Additionally, one should avoid scraping websites that require authentication as those tend to treat security very seriously.
