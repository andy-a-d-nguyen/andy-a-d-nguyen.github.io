## Pandas

According to <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html>, pandas is a very powerful and convenient library to perform calculations on 2-dimensional data (data that can be visualized as a table), which it calls a `DataFrame`. It provides ways to perform mathematical calculations and display graphs based on the data provided to it. It can also be used to calculate results from 1-dimensional data, which it calls a `Series`.
