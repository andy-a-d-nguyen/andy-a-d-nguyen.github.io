## Linear Regression

According to <https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/>, regression is the process of determining the relationship between two variables. One variable is considered the input variable and the other variable is considered the output variable. A linear regression is used to explain the relationship between these two variables as a line on a graph.

According to <https://www.crayondata.com/how-to-run-linear-regression-in-python-scikit-learn/>, scikit-learn is a very powerful open source library that provides ways to perform linear regression in Python and it is commonly used with NumPy.
