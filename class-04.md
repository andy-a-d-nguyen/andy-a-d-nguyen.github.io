## Classes and Objects

According to <https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects>, classes can be thought of as templates from which objects can be created. These objects share similarities based on the templates, but their properties and behaviors can differ slightly between objects.

A real life example of classes and objects is cars. All cars of the same make, model and year can be considered objects created from a template. Each of these cars will likely have the same shape and structure, but may have different colors. They may also have slightly different electronics installed based on the trims or features different customers wanted added or removed.

## Recursion

According to <https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/>, there are a couple of ways to think about what recursion is. One way to think about recursion is to think about a problem in which, if the problem is simple, solve it, and if not, divide the problem into smaller sub-problems and apply the same strategy to the sub-problems. Another way to think about recursion is that a recursive function will call itself until a stopping condition is met, at which point a result will be returned to the previous recursive calls.

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

According to <https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-testing-pytest-fixtures-and-coverage>, fixtures are essentially setup steps carried out before actual tests are run. Coverage is about ensuring that the code written has been adequately tested.

A real life example for fixtures is building houses. Before houses are built, foundation must be laid first.

A real life example for test coverage is crash tests for cars. Before a car can be deemed safe to be sold, it must undergo crash tests from multiple angles to ensure the passengers inside are safe in the event of collisions.
