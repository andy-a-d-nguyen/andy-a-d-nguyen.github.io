## Read and Write Files in Python

According to <https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/>, a file is a "contiguous set of bytes used to store data". Windows uses the backslash while Unix uses the forward slash to indicate a folder. Windows also uses CRLF (\r\n) to denote a line ending while Unix uses LF (\n) to denote a line ending.

When it comes to handling files in Python, ensuring that files are closed properly is very important. Also, Python comes with some built-in functionalities to open, close, read from and write to files.

## Exceptions in Python

According to <https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/>, exceptions occur when a Python program runs into an error. If this error is not handle, the program will crash. However, there are ways for the program to continue even when it comes across an error. One way is by catching it with the `try` and `except` block.
