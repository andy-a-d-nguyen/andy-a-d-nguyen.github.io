## Test Driven Development (TDD)

According to <https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932>, TDD makes a programmer think about what problems need to be solved first first before writing code. The way that's done to is to write tests, which acts as both documentation and also expectations for how the code should work and then write code that makes the tests pass. The more robust the test suite, the more documented the code is and the more confident a programmer feels about how the code performs in real life.

Using a real life example, TDD is similar to the cars that people drive on the roads. These cars have been tested to different extents as to meet safety requirements and laws before they are sold to the end consumers.

## if __name__ == '__main__'

According to <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if>-__name__-__main__-do/>, this is used to run any python file as if it's the main program. This is useful for running python files in a project as a standalone module

Using a real life example, this is similar to the smartphones people use nowadays. A phone originally only make calls, but today's phones can do so much more and their functionalities can be used independently of the functiona to call other people.

## Recursion

According to <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv9NEXX1VHc>, recursion is about solving sub-problems using the same function over and over until a base case where no further sub-problems exists. The result then cascades back to the original function that started the recursion calls

A real life example of recursion is solving puzzles. You don't know how long it will take to solve a puzzle, but you do know that a puzzle is solved once all of it's pieces are in place.
